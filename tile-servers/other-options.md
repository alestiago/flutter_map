## Other Servers

There are plenty of other tile servers you can choose from, free or paid. Most provide a static tile service/API, usually called Static Tiles or just Tile Requests (if no vector tiles are supported).

If you're responsible for a tile server, and want to have your tile server and setup instructions listed in this documentation, please get in touch!

A good catalogue of servers (usually called Providers elsewhere) can be found at the websites below:

## Serving Your Own Tiles

Switch2OSM also provides detailed instructions on how to serve your own tiles: this can be surprisingly economical and enjoyable if you don't mind a few hours in a Linux console.

However, this will require a very high-spec computer, especially for larger areas, and hosting this might be more complicated than it's worth. It's very difficult to fully understand the technologies involved.
